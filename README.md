## Summary

In today's streaming landscape, users face information overload with thousands of movies and TV shows spread across multiple platforms like Netflix, Disney+, etc. Many struggle to keep track of what they want to watch, often relying on messy notes, memory, or scattered lists across different apps. A [recent survey](https://nypost.com/2024/12/19/lifestyle/why-its-so-hard-to-find-something-to-watch-lately/) revealed that people spend an average of 110 hours a year just searching for content, while 51% feel overwhelmed by excessive recommendations. Additionally, growing [privacy concerns](https://www.thetimes.com/uk/technology-uk/article/how-to-stop-smart-tv-spying-on-you-pzfxx7mr8) around smart TVs and streaming services highlight the need for user-controlled, non-intrusive tracking tools.

Reel Tracker CLI is a lightweight, command-line-based personal watchlist manager designed for movie lovers, binge-watchers, film critics, and streaming enthusiasts. It helps users save and organize their watchlists, track watched content, and provide ratings and recommendations‚Äîall without intrusive data collection or algorithmic manipulation. By offering a privacy-focused, efficient, and customizable alternative to mainstream tracking apps, Reel Tracker CLI appeals to tech-savvy, data-conscious users who prefer self-managed solutions. The project also has potential for future expansion, including a front-end interface, user authentication, and database integration, making it valuable for market researchers and content licensing professionals as well.

## Backlog

The following features were *originally planned* but were not implemented in this phase due to a shift in priorities. Instead, we focused on *enhancing the user experience* by:

- Introducing [See title details](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/16)
- Handling [recommendations edge cases](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/11):
  - [No title rated 3+]
  - [List have only few items]
  - [Tie on preferred genre by frequency]
  - [No item in list matched preferred genre]

### Features Not Implemented:

#### Categorize your watchlist
- [As a user, I want to categorize my watchlist into sublists (e.g. ‚ÄúMust Watch‚Äù, ‚ÄúFor Later‚Äù) so that I can organize my movies better.](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/13)
  _This feature was *deprioritized* in favor of [See title details](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/16), which provide more information for user about the titles._

#### Random Movie Suggestion
- [As a user, I want to receive random movie suggestions so that I can easily pick what to watch next.](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/12) 
  _This feature was *deprioritized* in favor of [recommendations edge cases](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/11), which ensures coherent feedback to user and better recommendations._

## Features

### üéØ Core Functionality

#### User Flow Overview
The diagram below illustrates how users interact with the core features of the ReelTracker CLI.

![Reeltracker Flowchart](documentation/reeltracker_flowcharts.png)

#### Search titles via TMDb API

Users can search for movies or TV shows by keyword. The app returns results from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, including title, type, release year, and a short overview.
Related user story:  [#3 Search for a title](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/3)

![Search prompt](documentation/search_1.png)
![Search results](documentation/search_2.png)

#### Add to watchlist
Users can add any title from the search results directly to their personal watchlist for future viewing.
Related user story:  [#4 Add to watchlist or Viewing History](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/4)

![Add to watchlist](documentation/watchlist_1.png)

#### Mark titles as watched and assign ratings
Users can mark a title as watched and give it a personal rating from 1 to 5. This allows them to track both progress and preferences.
Related user story:  [#5 View lists](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/5), [#9 Rate watched title](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/9), [#14 Update title](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/14)

![Add as watched](documentation/watched_1.png)

####  Move titles between lists
A title can be moved from the Watchlist to the Viewing History once watched, preserving metadata such as date added.
When moving a title from Viewing History to Watchlist, watched data and rating are reset.

#### Delete title from lists
Users can delete a title from the lists.
Related user story:  [#6 Remove a title from lists](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/6)

![Delete action](documentation/delete.png)

#### Title recommendations
The system analyzes genre patterns from previously watched content, identifies top-rated titles (ratings ‚â• 3), and sorts the watchlist based on genre similarity and media type preference. This allows users to receive tailored suggestions that reflect their actual taste and not generic trends or ads.
Related user stories:[#9 Rate watched title](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/9), [#11 Get recommendations](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/11)

##### See what's trending
Allows users to explore trending titles based on real-time popularity data from The Movie Database (TMDb). This feature is especially useful when users are just getting started or looking for something new outside of their personal watchlist. 
Trending titles are also shown when for recommendation flows where the user has no titles in their watchlist or viewing history.
Related user story:[#10 See what's trending](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/10)

### üìÅ Data Storage & Sync

#### Google Sheets integration 
All user data (watchlist, history, ratings) is stored in a personal Google Sheet via the Sheets API. This ensures cloud persistence and makes data accessible outside the CLI.
- Uses `gspread` and `google-auth` for integration
- Credentials are safely loaded from a `.json` file and hidden using `.gitignore`

#### Reload and reconstruct data
The app can rebuild `Title` objects from the spreadsheet using the `from_sheet_row()` method. This ensures data continuity across sessions.

### üìà Smart Sorting & Discovery

#### Weighted popularity sorting

A custom `calculate_weighted_popularity()` function ensures titles are ranked based on both `TMDb popularity` and `vote count`. This prevents obscure titles with low votes from unfairly topping the list. Search output uses this function to display most relevant item on top with the use of `sort_items_by_popularity`.

- [FreeCodeCamp lambda sort list in Python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/lambda-sort-list-in-python/)

#### Recommmendation workflow
1. **Analyze viewing history** 
The system identifies titles rated 3 or higher in the watched list using `get_top_rated_titles()`. 
It then determines a preferred genre using rating-weighted frequency via `get_preferred_genre()`

2. **Sort the watchlist** 
If watchlist titles exist:

- It attempts to filter by the preferred genre using `filter_list_by_genre()`.
- If genre matches are found, titles are ranked by genre similarity to a top-rated title and popularity using `sort_titles_by_relevance()`.
- Titles are then reordered to prioritize the user‚Äôs preferred media type (movie or TV) via `reorder_titles_by_media_type()`

3. **Show personalized list**
The resulting sorted list is displayed to the user for selection via `display_title_entries()` and `display_and_select_title()`

4. **Handle edge cases**
When recommendations cannot be generated due to lack of data, the system will:
- No top-rated titles: Calls `handle_no_top_rated()`, which analyzes all titles (watched + watchlist) and uses TMDb‚Äôs discovery API based on inferred media type and genre.
- Very few items (‚â§3): A warning is printed indicating limited recommendation accuracy.
- Tied genre frequency: The `get_preferred_genre()` function uses rating totals as a tiebreaker.
- No genre matches in watchlist: Falls back to sorting entire watchlist by genre similarity and popularity, skipping genre filtering.


### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling 

#### Input validation

- Invalid menu options prompt the user to try again (`get_menu_choice`)
- Malformed commands (like `w x`) return a helpful message explaining the issue (`handle_action_with_index`)
- Ratings must be numeric and between 1‚Äì10; otherwise, the user is re-prompted (`get_title_rating`)
- Empty search queries are rejected with clear prompts (`get_user_search_input`)

#### Index and Selection Handling

When selecting items from a list:

- Out-of-range indexes (e.g. choosing item 10 in a list of 3) are caught and explained (`select_item_from_results`)
- Non-numeric selections result in a descriptive error, and the user is given a chance to try again

#### External API & Sheets Failures

- TMDb API requests (e.g. `fetch_tmdb_results`) handle network timeouts, invalid responses, and missing keys with user-friendly messages.
- Google Sheets operations check for missing worksheets and initialize them as needed (`save_item_to_list`, `get_titles_by_watch_status`).
- If the Google Sheet is missing or the `creds.json` is misconfigured, the app will not crash but instead show a clear error and exit gracefully.

#### Graceful Recovery

Whenever possible, users will be given the option to retry or return to a safe state (e.g. re-search, go back to the main menu) rather than exiting abruptly.

### üß∞ Interface & Code Design

#### Clean and readable terminal output
The UI adapts to Heroku CLI constraints (80x24), avoiding broken formatting and wrapping issues. Multi-line outputs (like overviews) are carefully indented for clarity.

#### Modular code architecture 
The codebase is structured in modules by responsibility. This improves readability, scalability, and maintainability.

### 4. Set up Google API

This project uses Google Sheets to store personal viewing history and watchlist. You'll need to enable Drive and Google Sheets API on your Google Cloud to be able to configure your personal list.

#### I. Creating a project

- Start by navigating to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/). If you don't have a Google account, you'll need to create one.
- Create a new project. [Check the official documentation on new project creation](https://developers.google.com/workspace/guides/create-project).

#### II. Enable APIs
- Go to your project home and navigate to _APIs and Services > Library_.
- Search for Google Drive API, navigate to its page and click on **Enable**.
- Follow the same process to activate Google Sheets API.

#### III. Get Credentials
- In your project view, navigate to _APIs and Services > Credentials_.
- Click on **Create credentials** button, select **Help me choose**.
- On the form, select **Google Drive API** on the dropdownlist os APIs.
- Select **App Data** regarding the type of data to be used.
- Fill in the name of the service account and the account ID (_You'll need this to configure your script_).
- Click and **Create and Continue**. 

####  IV. Save credentials information
- You'll be redirect to a credential screen. Select the e-mail address under **Service Account** and click on the edit button.
- Navigate to Keys and go to _Add Key > Create New Key_
- Select JSON and create.
- This action will automatically trigger a download of the json file.

#### V. Project configuration
- Move the downloaded file to the root folder of your project. You can name it **creds.json** as I did, or give it another name. Just be sure that the name is matching in your `run.py` file.
- On your Google account, create a new Google Sheets document. You can name it `reeltracker_cli` as I did, or give it another unique name. Just be sure that the name is matching in your `run.py` file.
- On your new file, click on the share button and copy&paste the e-mail address that can be found in your creds.json.
- If you haven't yet, install `gspread` and `google-auth` libraries.
- Add the following code to your project to set up your Google API connection:

    ```python
    import gspread
    from google.oauth2.service_account import Credentials

    SCOPE = [
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/spreadsheets",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file",
    "https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive"
    ]

    CREDS = Credentials.from_service_account_file('<your_creds_file_name>.json')
    SCOPED_CREDS = CREDS.with_scopes(SCOPE)
    GSPREAD_CLIENT = gspread.authorize(SCOPED_CREDS)
    SHEET =  GSPREAD_CLIENT.open('<your_google_sheet_name>')
    ```

### 5. Set up TMDB API

This project uses TMDB API to fetch data of movies and TV Shows. You'll need to create an account and request an API Key.

#### I. Requesting the API Key

- Go to [TMDB Signup](https://www.themoviedb.org/signup)
- Once signed in, request an API key at [TMDB API page](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api).

#### II. Project Configuration
-  If you haven't yet, install `requests` and `python-dotenv` libraries.
- Create a .env file on your root folder and add your API key `TMDB_API_KEY=your_actual_tmdb_api_key_here`.
- Optionally, you can also add the TMDB API URL `TMDB_URL ='https://api.themoviedb.org/3'`
- Add .env to your .gitignore file to ensure it's never pushed to GitHub.
- Load API Key from .env file:

    ```python
    import os
    from dotenv import load_dotenv

    # Load environment variables from .env file
    load_dotenv()

    # Access TMDB API key
    TMDB_API_KEY = os.getenv('TMDB_API_KEY')
    TMDB_URL = os.getenv('TMDB_URL') # if stored in .env otherwise TMDB_URL ='https://api.themoviedb.org/3'

    if TMDB_API_KEY is None:
       raise ValueError("TMDB_API_KEY not found. Check your .env file.")
    ```

#### III. Test API Request
- Test your configuration by sending an API request:
    ```python
    TMDB_URL = os.getenv('TMDB_URL')
    LANGUAGE ='language=en-US'
    TMDB_API_KEY = os.getenv('TMDB_API_KEY')

    url = f'{TMDB_URL}/movie/popular?api_key={TMDB_API_KEY}&{LANGUAGE}&page=1'
    response = requests.get(url,timeout=10)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return data['results']
    else:
        print(f"Error: {response.status_code}, {response.text}")
        return []

    ```
- You can install `rich` library for an easier read of the json response
    ```python
    import json
    from rich import print_json

    url = f'{TMDB_URL}/movie/popular?api_key={api_key}&{LANGUAGE}&page=1'
    response = requests.get(url,timeout=10)
    if response.status_code == 200:
        data = response.json()
        return data['results']
    ```



### 6. Run the application

Once everything is configured, run the CLI tool:

```bash
python run.py
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the ReelTracker menu in your terminal.

## Deploy to Heroku

### Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`

- All credentials and API keys are excluded via `.gitignore` and environment variables

### ü™≤ Bug Fixes
- [Issue #15](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/15) App was crashing because `title.py` is importing functions from `utils.py` and vice versa. The modular structure of the app was modified to avoid circular imports.
- [Issue #17](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/17) If a user has only rated titles 2 or below, the recommendation will crash the application. Initial fix to mitigate this was to provide a feedback to the user that the data was not suficient. Later, a fallback to `show_trending_titles` was implemented. 
- [Issue #18](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/18) Display of recommendation list for specific use case (no watched titles) was not sorting the titles by popularity. The issue was caused due to an attempt to reuse the function originally created to sort TMDb lists to sort Google Sheets list. Some [refactoring](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/commit/1eb9a17b6e33c60e71990356cc07b5c809283346) was required for the function to work as expected.
- [Issue #19](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/19) Edge case testing: sheet is renamed or deleted in the Drive in the middle of an action. Since the app was only handling exceptions for save item, the app would crash in other cases. Although it is an edge case, adding logic for `WorksheetNotFound` for update and delete use cases improves overall error handling. A `get_or_create_worksheet` function was created and reused across `crud.py` file.
- [Issue #20](https://github.com/larevolucia/reeltracker_cli/issues/20) App crashed when comparing string ratings values with integers. This happened due to manual intervention directly in Google Sheets to simulate a test case. Although it is unlikely to happen via CLI usage, a conditional to only perform the task when rating is either an integer or float was added to `get_top_rated_titles` function at `filters.py`.
